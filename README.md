# CurrencyConverter

A simple, minimalistic currency converter written in Java & Gradle, targeting Android 14+ (API level
30, but the minimum operable SDK is 28).

### Random things about it:

- Long press on the currency will open a Maps app and take you to the country's capital.
- Updating the currency fetches for data from an online website and then prompts the user if they
  were successfully updated or not via a Notification as well as a Toast notification.
- The share button will allow you to send the result of the conversion via different applications to
  your friends.
- APK file can be found inside the app/release directory.
